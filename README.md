# prime-pair-visualizer
Prime pairs are drawn on a classic graph on the left. 
The axes of the graph to the right are the result of a rotation of -45 degrees relative to the classic graph axes.
Points are drawn on this graph that have the property that they map to a prime pair when transformed to the classic graph.
